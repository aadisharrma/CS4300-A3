# scene-commands.txt
# This is the main file that ties everything together.

# 1) define root
createNode sceneRoot group
setActive sceneRoot

# 2) define some ground
def matGround
Ka 0.1 0.1 0.1
Kd 0.3 0.5 0.3  # a greenish ground color
Ks 0.2 0.2 0.2
Ns 10
setMaterial matGround

createNode ground geometry box
setMaterial ground matGround
scale ground 50 0.5 50
translate ground 0 -0.25 0
attach ground sceneRoot

# 3) import building, turret, and position them
import building-commands.txt
attach buildingRoot sceneRoot

# if you kept turret separate:
import turret-commands.txt
attach turretRoot sceneRoot

# move the turret on top of the building
translate turretRoot 0 4 0   # adjust as needed
# (or attach turretRoot to buildingRoot if you want it parented)

# 4) import humanoids
import humanoid1-commands.txt
import humanoid2-commands.txt
attach humanoid1Root sceneRoot
attach humanoid2Root sceneRoot

# position them somewhere on the ground
translate humanoid1Root -10 0 0
rotate humanoid1Root 0 90 0   # face the building, etc.

translate humanoid2Root 10 0 0
rotate humanoid2Root 0 -45 0

# 5) You can create more copies of the building if you like
# For instance, load building-commands again or define more buildings.
# Make sure you have at least 10 total instances in your building + turret, etc.

# That's it! We now have:
# - A ground plane
# - A building with walls & roof (≥ 5+ pieces)
# - A turret (≥ 2 pieces)
# - 2 humanoids with different poses
